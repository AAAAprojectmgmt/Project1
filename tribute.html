    <h2>About Sangolli Rayanna:</h2>
    <p>Sangolli Rayanna (15 August 1798 – 26 January 1831) was an Indian military leader. Born in Sangolli, Belagavi district. His father was Bharamappa Rogannavar. His mother was Kenchava. He served as a senior commander in the military of Kittur ruled by Kittur Chennamma, the kingdom - like many others - called by the British as a princely state, during the early 19th century. After Chennamma led a failed rebellion against the British East India Company (EIC) in response to the EIC's infamous Doctrine of Lapse in 1824, Rayanna continued to resist Company rule in India. After leading another uprising against EIC authority, he was ultimately captured by the British and executed by hanging in 1831. As he played a very important role in Indian Freedom, his memorial statue was built in the village of Sangolli, Belagavi. Rayanna's life was the subject of the Kannada-language films Kranthiveera Sangolli Rayanna (1967) and Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna (2012).[1][2]</p>
